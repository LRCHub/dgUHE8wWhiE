Ayo these chicks love me, and even though I got chubby
Mommy see me in the club want pop bubble
I'm like, "Yo ma stop it, cause I'm a Smirnoff rocket
I'm loving my life, and never out of pocket
I fuck dogstyle chick, I'm thugged out and rich
I drink Henny that's the same shit that I piss
And I don't care about a ice wrist, I got a ice pick
Plus a ice chick, she suck ice dick"

God favorite so they stay attracted
And you could fuck with the guard or get subtracted
I'll have you hideout, like when thugged out slide out
These niggaz listen like when swizz scream, "Rideout"
N O R, twenties on rims on ill car
You could ask Def Jam they inherited a star
You see I take flicks, and we hit the knick chicks
Bag twenties and sell them in the hood for nicks

They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But you can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
N O R E, N O R E
They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But you can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's

It's still bang bang, yeah mommy, it's still the same thing
And you could feel on my jock, and see I'm all cock
And we could chill on your block, why not
Niggaz love me anywhere, a hood I'm there
I told niggas last year, that I ain't care
You acting like the little nigga break yo, still don't care
Whoa so if you with it, I can hit it and go
And call you from the hood later, after hugging some doe

N O I keep it all good, I smoke more wood
And as far as my chicks, I keep them all hood
One time Jake chased me, I started to dip them
And when I ran by Shortie, she started to trip them
Damn Shortie "what" we've been through a lot together
I even had you on the block slinging rocks together
It's not a stress day, so I'm hit the expressway
Meet you at your crib in a hour, with a dress tray

They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
N O R E, N O R E
They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
N O R E, N O R E

I'm from Q U double E N S
The first nigga selling crack with a black G S
I like the Lex, nigga so I copped the shit
And now it's summer time now, so I dropped the shit
Whenever, you want beef, better get it together
'Cause I can have niggaz follow you and blast your leather
You see we thugged out, and got whips with deep disses
Go head and keep trying, you could sleep with the fishes
Here goes

They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
N O R E, N O R E
They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
N O R E, N O R E

They want to be like him, smoke like him, live like him
But they can't fuck with, thug like him, dro like him
If you forgot the name, and you are wondering it's
