How can you love him if you don't even like him?
You call him your lover, he ain't even your best friend
Left in the wings, I waiting for the curtain to fall
How you gonna love him if you don't even like him at all?

For what it's worth, I hope it all works out
But you won't find me when he finally lets you down

How can you love him if you don't even like him?
You call him your lover, he ain't even your best friend
Left in the wings, I waiting for the curtain to fall
How you gonna love him if you don't even like him at all?

When he comes around you wear a plastic smile
Maybe you've got him fooled, but I can see it from a mile

How can you love him if you don't even like him?
You call him your lover, he ain't even your best friend
Left in the wings, I waiting for the curtain to fall
How you gonna love him if you don't even like him at all?
Tell me how you gonna love him if you don't even like him at all?
