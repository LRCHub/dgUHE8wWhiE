[Fanny:]
Say it's only a paper moon, sailing over a cardboard see
But it wouldn't be make belief if you belief in me

I like him I know he's phoney
But when they packages it nice and market it right
I buy beloney
Yes I like him though I can see that he's the type
I'd better get busy and do unto to first
Before I find he's done unto me
He's mostly made of chutzpah
A fake a con a lie
Could be I like him cause
So am I
