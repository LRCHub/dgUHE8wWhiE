That's just like, just like Jesus
THAT'S just like Christ
That's just like, just Jesus
That's just like Him.
Make a way out of no way
Turn midnight into day
Friend to friendless
Mother to the motherless
He's a burden bearer
Heavy low sharer
Brings PEACE in confusion
Joy and sorrow
He's a bridge over troubled waters
That's just like Him
THAT'S just... like Him
That's just like Him
Brought me out of darkness
Into a marvelous light
Place my feet on straight street
Gave me the strength to fight
THAT'S just... like Him
That's just like Him
Sapranos, Altos, Tenors ALL

Brought me out of darkness
Into a MARVELOUS light
Place my feet on straight street
Gave me the strength to fight
Running in my feet
Clapping in my hands
Praises on my lips
Joy in my heart
He puts living water
Down in my soul
Every since the the Holy Ghost
Came and took control
Gave me a song
The angels cannot sing
Glory hallelujah, I've been redeemed

THAT'S just... like Him
That's just like him
