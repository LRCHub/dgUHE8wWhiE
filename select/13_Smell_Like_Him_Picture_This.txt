I wish i could forget about
How you put your cigarette out
I wish my mind would forget the smell of your skin
And i wish i didn't think about
How you'd go buy another round
And walk back to me with that devilish grin
Cuz my head will be sore in the morning
And my heart will be broken too
But if we just live in the moment
Is there a chance i'd forget about you?
Cause I don't know
Where you've been
But you smell like him
You smell like him
And were you in his arms?
You must have been
Cause you smell like him
You smell like him
Oh i wish my mind would just erase
The memories we have in place
Of every longboat and every hotel room
Yeah i wish that i could clear my mind
And forget about all the times
That i spent just looking after you
Cuz my head will be sore in the morning
And my heart will be broken too
But if we just lived in the moment
Is there a chance i'd forget about you?
Cause i don't know
Where you've been
But you smell like him
You smell like him
Where you in his arms?
You must have been
Cause you smell like him
You smell like him
And i don't want you to be happy
If you're not happy with me
And i know that sounds dramatic
But thats how my heart feels
Cause i don't know
Where you've been
But you ell like him
You smell like him
And where you in his arms?
You must have been
Cause you smell like him
You smell like him
